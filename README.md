# TheMinimalist
Have you ever wanted to reduce clutter and get rid of stuff but thought to yourself, "But what if I need this later?" or "I only use this once a year and it takes up so much space!" The answer to this dilema is: *TheMinimalist*.

*TheMinimalist* is a peer-to-peer rental service for any and all of those things that you might need just once a year. If you have an item that you want to rent, or that you want to rent out to others for extra money, look no further! You journey to a clutter-free life starts now :)

# App Introduction
We strive to make the experience of the app match our minimalist philosophy: simple, high quality, and enjoyable. All of our pages emulate this philosophy, so relax and enjoy!

## Login
You probably want less, but no one wants stuff stolen, so we take your security seriously. Every use needs to login. Eventually we will enable login through Facebook, Google, GitHub, and others, as well as two factor authentication. This is at the top of our priority list.
